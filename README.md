# Phys51-2018

This is a repository for LaTeX and PDF files for E&M. This repo is designed to be a place where all TeXers alike can come together and crank out beautiful looking homework files so that we don't have to get points taken off for not copying over the problems properly. 

If there are mistakes--please let us know by making an issue in the issues tab. That being said, you as the user are responsible for making sure that the homework that you do is correct. That means if something is wrong with the TeX file, whether it be a wrong number or a missing problem, it is your responsibility to take care of that issue. Do not blame the person that TeXed up the homeork if there is a problem with your homework.

Lastly and most importantly--a lot of people (special shout out to Thomas Martinez) put in a fair amount of time and effort into doing this for little recognition and no monetary compensation. That means they're doing this out of the charity of their own hearts. If you get the chance, please please, PLEASE extend your thanks to them. By doing this, they're really helping everyone out :)
