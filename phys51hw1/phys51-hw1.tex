\begin{problem}[(E25.30)]
Two physics students (Mary at \val{52.0}{kg} and John at \val{90.7}{kg}) are \val{28.0}{m} apart. Let each have a 0.01\% imbalance in their
amounts of positive and negative charge, one student being positive and the other negative. Estimate the electrostatic force of attraction between them.
(Hint: Replace the students by spheres of water and use the result of Exercise 29.)

\begin{problem}[(P25.4(a))*]
Two similar tiny balls of mass $m$ are hung from silk threads of length $L$ and carry equal charges $q$ as in the figure below. Assume that
$\theta$ is so small that $\tan\theta$ can be replaced by approximate equal, $\sin\theta$. (a) To this approximation show that, for equilibrium,
$$
	x = \pn{\frac{q^2L}{2\pi\epsilon_0mg}}^{1/3},
$$
where $x$ is the separation between the balls.

\begin{problem}[(E26.16)]
A thin glass rod is bent into a semicircle of radius $r$. A charge $+q$ is uniformly distributed along the upper half and a charge $-q$ is uniformly
distributed along the lower half, as shown in the figure below. Find the electric field $\VEC{E}$ at $P$, the center of the semicircle.

\begin{problem}[(P25.8)]
Two positive charges $+Q$ are held fixed a distance $d$ apart. A particle of negative $-q$ and mass $m$ is placed mid-way between them, 
then is given a small displacement perpendicular to the line joining them and released. Show that the particle describes simple harmonic motion of period
$$\pn{\epsilon_0m\pi^3d^3/qQ}^{1/2}.$$\\
\textit{Hint:} Remember the small angle approximation for $\sin x$ when $x$ is small, and remember that for simple harmonic oscillations, restoring force is linearly
proportional to displacement, as in $F = -kx$.

\begin{problem}[\P (E26.18)]
An insulating rod of length $L$ has charge $-q$ uniformly distributed along its length, as shown in the figure below. (a) What is the linear charge density of the rod? (b) Find the electric
field at point $P$ a distance $a$ from the end of the rod. (c) If $P$ were very far from the rod compared to $L$, the rod would look like a point charge. Show that your answer to (b) reduces to the electric field of a point charge for $a \gg L$.
